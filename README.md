# Node SDK

The Node SDK is a toolkit created with the goal of easily integrating OpenPix services into your Node.js applications.

It allows you to create recurring subscriptions, charges, payment requests, webhooks, as well as manage other API data.

You can send custom requests using our client, which adds all necessary information, such as authentication details, and decodes responses in JSON format.

Using our integrated paginator, it's easy to create pagination for data listing. It's supported on all data listing endpoints.

The SDK is officially maintained by OpenPix and distributed via [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The code is hosted in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/woovibr/woovi-nodejs-sdk).

Take a look at [how to use it](./docs/usage.md).
